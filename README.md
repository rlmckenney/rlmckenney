## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you!
### I'm Robert (he/him). 

- I really enjoy building things that make other people's lives just a little bit better.
- I love learning new, more elegant ways of solving problems.
- And, I love teaching other people about what I have learned.
- Iâ€™m currently teaching Full-stack Web Development with JavaScript, React, Node, MySQL and MongoDB.
- I also provide consulting support for Start-ups.

### Philosophy âœ¨
- Everyone has something to teach
- Listen more than you talk
- Write code for humans
- The most important question in understanding user requirements is "Why?" not "What?"

### How I build code ðŸ¤”
- Break the problem down into the smallest testable units
- Make it work (even if it's ugly)
- Make it better (DRY, SOLID) - be nice to the next person to touch this code
- Test it
- Ship it
- Make it faster - when the volume of data/transactions _needs_ it.
